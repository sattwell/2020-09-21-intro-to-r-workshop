# Learning Objectives
#---------------------

#    Describe the purpose of the dplyr and tidyr packages.
#    Select certain columns in a data frame with the dplyr function select.
#    Select certain rows in a data frame according to filtering conditions with the dplyr function filter .
#    Link the output of one dplyr function to the input of another function with the ‘pipe’ operator %>%.
#    Add new columns to a data frame that are functions of existing columns with mutate.
#    Use the split-apply-combine concept for data analysis.
#    Use summarize, group_by, and count to split a data frame into groups of observations, apply summary statistics for each group, and then combine the results.
#    Describe the concept of a wide and a long table format and for which purpose those formats are useful.
#    Describe what key-value pairs are.
#    Reshape a data frame from long to wide format and back with the pivit_wider and pivit_longer commands from the tidyr package.
#    Export a data frame to a .csv file.

# The pipe --> %>%
#Shortcut --, Ctrl+ shift+ m or command + shift + m

#-----------
# CHALLENGE
#-----------

# Using pipes, subset the ```surveys``` data to include animals collected before 1995 and 
# retain only the columns ```year```, ```sex```, and ```weight```.

surveys_1995 <- surveys %>% 
  filter(year < 1995) %>% 
  select(year, sex, weight)

#ordering your columns DOES matter






#--------
# Mutate
#--------
surveys%>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight/ 1000,
         weight_lb =weight * 2.2)

surveys_weights <-surveys%>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight/ 1000,
         weight_lb =weight * 2.2)

surveys%>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight/ 1000,
         weight_lb =weight * 2.2)
  head()
  
surveys%>%
    mutate(weight_kg = weight/ 1000,
           weight_lb =weight * 2.2)
  tail()
  

surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  mutate(weight_kg= weight/ 1000) %>%
  head()
  
filter(length !="")

#-----------
# CHALLENGE
#-----------

# Create a new data frame from the ```surveys``` data that meets the following criteria: 
# contains only the ```species_id``` column and a new column called ```hindfoot_cm``` containing 
# the ```hindfoot_length``` values converted to centimeters. In this hindfoot_cm column, 
# there are no ```NA```s and all values are less than 3.

# Hint: think about how the commands should be ordered to produce this data frame!

surveys_new <-surveys %>% 
  filter(!is.na(hindfoot_length)) %>% 
  mutate(hindfoot_cm = hindfoot_length / 10) %>% 
  filter(hindfoot_cm < 3) %>% 
  select(species_id, hindfoot_cm)




#---------------------
# Split-apply-combine
#---------------------






#-----------
# CHALLENGE
#-----------

# 1. How many animals were caught in each ```plot_type``` surveyed?

# 2. Use ```group_by()``` and ```summarize()``` to find the mean, min, and max hindfoot length 
#    for each species (using ```species_id```). Also add the number of observations 
#    (hint: see ```?n```).

# 3. What was the heaviest animal measured in each year? 
#    Return the columns ```year```, ```genus```, ```species_id```, and ```weight```.





#-----------
# Reshaping
#-----------







#-----------
# CHALLENGE
#-----------

# 1. Spread the surveys data frame with year as columns, plot_id as rows, 
#    and the number of genera per plot as the values. You will need to summarize before reshaping, 
#    and use the function n_distinct() to get the number of unique genera within a particular chunk of data. 
#    It’s a powerful function! See ?n_distinct for more.

# 2. Now take that data frame and pivot_longer() it again, so each row is a unique plot_id by year combination.

# 3. The surveys data set has two measurement columns: hindfoot_length and weight. 
#    This makes it difficult to do things like look at the relationship between mean values of each 
#    measurement per year in different plot types. Let’s walk through a common solution for this type of problem. 
#    First, use pivot_longer() to create a dataset where we have a key column called measurement and a value column that 
#    takes on the value of either hindfoot_length or weight. 
#    Hint: You’ll need to specify which columns are being pivoted.

# 4. With this new data set, calculate the average of each measurement in each year for each different plot_type. 
#    Then pivot_wider() them into a data set with a column for hindfoot_length and weight. 
#    Hint: You only need to specify the key and value columns for pivot_wider().
